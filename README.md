# VMware has ended active development of this project, this repository will no longer be updated.

Photon Go Cli
===============

The repo for the Photon go cli.

## Setup

The project requires go version 1.6+. You can download and install go from: https://golang.org/dl/

Decide a folder as the GOPATH, e.g. ~/go.

    1. mkdir -p ~/go/src/github.com/vmware/
    2. cd ~/go/src/github.com/vmware/
    3. git clone (this repo from gerrit or github)
    4. cd photon-controller-cli
    5. export GOPATH=~/go
    6. export PATH=$PATH:~/go/bin
    7. make tools


## Build and Test

To run the test:

      make test

To build the executables:

      make build

The executables are generated under photon-controller-cli/bin folder.

To run and verify the CLI:

       ./bin/photon -v


## Pick up Changes from SDK

When there are changes in SDK, wait for them promoted to **_master_** branch on **_github.com_**.

Follow the steps below:

    1. go get -u github.com/vmware/photon-controller-go-sdk/photon
    2. govendor update github.com/vmware/photon-controller-go-sdk/...

Before comitting the change, carefully inspect the changes to Godeps, for example with git diff or SourceTree.

Then you can commit and submit the change.

## Example Usage

Notes:

* Commands below are shown as you type-them. The "%" indicates a command-line prompt.
* These are illustrative examples. Not all commands or parameters are described.


### Getting help

The photon CLI includes extensive usage description that you can use to
discover various operations.

For instance, you can see the top-level commands with:

    % photon help
    NAME:
       photon - Command line interface for Photon Controller

    USAGE:
       photon [global options] command [command options] [arguments...]

       photon tenant - options for tenant

    USAGE:
       photon tenant command [command options] [arguments...]

       help, h              Shows a list of commands or help for one command

    OPTIONS:
       --help, -h	show help

### Interactive vs. Non-interactive mode
All commands work in two mode: interactive and non-interactive. Interactive
mode will prompt you for parameters you do not provide on the command-line
and will print human-readable output. Non-interactive mode will not prompt
you and will print machine-readable output.

### IDs
Objects in Photon Controller are given unique IDs, and most commands
refer to them using those IDs.

### Setting a target
Before you can use the photon CLI, you need to tell it which Photon Controller
to use.

Usage: `photon target set <PHOTON-CONTROLLER-URL>`

Example:

    % photon target set -c https://198.51.100.41
    API target set to 'https://198.51.100.41'

If you are not using HTTPS, specify the port:

    % photon target set http://198.51.100.41:9000
    API target set to 'http://198.51.100.41:9000'

### Tenants

Creating a tenant will tell you the ID of the tenant:

Usage: `photon tenant create <TENANT-NAME>`

Example:

    % photon -n tenant create cloud-dev
    cloud-dev	502f9a79-96b6-451d-bfb9-6292ca5b6cfd

You can list all tenants:

    % photon -n tenant list
    502f9a79-96b6-451d-bfb9-6292ca5b6cfd	cloud-dev

### Set tenant for other commands
Many commands take a --tenant parameter because the object in
question is owned by a tenant. As a convenience, you can avoid
passing that parameter, you can set the tenant for future commands:

Usage: `photon tenant set <TENANT-NAME>`

Example:

    % photon tenant set cloud-dev
    Tenant set to 'cloud-dev'

The tenant will be stored in a configuration file in your home directory,
within a subdirectory named _.photon-config_.

You can see what the current tenant is:

    % photon tenant get
    Current tenant is 'cloud-dev' 502f9a79-96b6-451d-bfb9-6292ca5b6cfd

### Quota
You assign quota to control the resource allocations granted to tenants and projects.

A quota must specify the number of VMs that can be created as well as the total amount
of RAM consumed by those VMs. If a flavor is used for VM creation, all of its costs
must be in the quota including ephemeral and persistent disk capacities. It's possible
to have user-defined quota as well. These are specified as comma-separated limits, and
each limit is a set of three things:

* Name (e.g. vm.memory)
* Value (e.g. 2000)
* Units (GB, MB, KB, COUNT)

Creating a tenant with quota assigned (see above, or use the --tenant flag):

Usage `photon tenant create cloud-dev --limits "<LIMITS>"`

Example:

    % photon -n tenant create --name cloud-dev
             --limits "vm.memory 2000 GB, vm 1000 COUNT, ephemeral-disk.capacity 2000 GB"
    32ad527e-d21a-4b2a-a235-b0883bd64354

Creating a tenant with user-defined resources:

    % photon -n tenant create --name cloud-dev
             --limits "vm.memory 2000 GB, vm 1000 COUNT, ephemeral-disk.capacity 2000 GB, vm.potrzebie 250 COUNT"
    32ad527e-d21a-4b2a-a235-b0883bd64354


### Projects
A project is owned by a tenant and all VMs are created within a project. Each
project is assigned with a quota that controls the total resources
that can be used. See above for more information about quota.

A project has a set of limits. These are specified just like the quota above,
but they must not exceed the limits in the tenant.

Creating a project:

Usage: `photon project create <PROJECT-NAME> --limits <LIMITS>`

    % photon -n project create cloud-dev-staging --limits "vm.memory 1000 GB, vm 500 COUNT"
    fabb9236-d0a4-4d30-8935-ee65d6729f78

Viewing projects:

    % photon -n project list
    fabb9236-d0a4-4d30-8935-ee65d6729f78 cloud-dev-staging vm.memory:1000:GB,vm:500:COUNT vm.memory:0:GB,vm:0:COUNT

Setting the project (applies to commands that require a project, like creating a VM).
If you prefer, you can pass the --project flag:

    % photon -n project set cloud-dev-staging

### Flavors
When a VM is made, it is described using two kinds of flavors: VM and disk. The flavors
describes how many resources are consumed by the VM from the resource ticket.

The cost argument specifies a set of costs, each separated by commas. Each cost consists of three value:

* Name
* Value, which will be subtracted from the resource ticket when the VM is created
* Units: GB, MB, KB, B, or COUNT

Note that VM flavors must specify at least the vm.cpu and vm.memory costs. Other
user-defined costs may be included as well, if desired. They should match the
resources in the resource ticket.

Creating a VM flavor with with 1 VM, 1 CPU and 2 GB RAM:

Usage: `photon flavor create --name <FLAVOR-NAME> --kind <KIND> --cost <COST>`

Example:

    % photon -n flavor create --name "cloud-vm-small" --kind "vm"
             --cost "vm 1.0 COUNT, vm.cpu 1.0 COUNT, vm.memory 2.0 GB"
    ddfb5be0-3355-46d3-9f2f-e28750eb201b

Creating a VM flavor with user-defined attributes:

    % photon -n flavor create --name "cloud-vm-small" --kind "vm"
             --cost "vm 1.0 COUNT, vm.cpu 1.0 COUNT, vm.memory 2.0 GB vm.potrzebie 10"
    ddfb5be0-3355-46d3-9f2f-e28750eb201b

Creating a disk flavor:

    % photon -n flavor create --name "cloud-disk"
             --kind "ephemeral-disk" --cost "ephemeral-disk 1.0 COUNT"
    78efc53a-88ce-4f09-9b5d-49662d21e56c

Viewing flavors:

    % photon -n flavor list
    78efc53a-88ce-4f09-9b5d-49662d21e56c	cloud-disk	ephemeral-disk	ephemeral-disk:1:COUNT
    ddfb5be0-3355-46d3-9f2f-e28750eb201b	cloud-vm-small	vm	vm:1:COUNT,vm.cpu:1:COUNT,vm.memory:2:GB

    % photon flavor show ddfb5be0-3355-46d3-9f2f-e28750eb201b

      Name:  cloud-vm-small
      Kind:  vm
      Cost:  [vm 1 COUNT vm.cpu 1 COUNT vm.memory 2 GB]
      State: READY

### Images

Uploading an image (OVA, OVF, or VMDK). The replication type is either EAGER or ON_DEMAND

Usage: `photon image create <IMAGE-FILENAME> -n <IMAGE-NAME> -i <TYPE>`

Example:

    % photon image create photon.ova -n photon-os -i EAGER
    Created image 'photon-os' ID: 8d0b9383-ff64-4112-85db-e8111e2269fc

    DELETE_IMAGE completed for 'image' entity 8d0b9383-ff64-4112-85db-e8111e2269fc

Note that if you delete an image that is being used by a VM, it will
go into the PENDING_DELETE state. It will be deleted once all VMs that
are using it have also been deleted.

    % photon image show 8d0b9383-ff64-4112-85db-e8111e2269fc

### VMs

When you create a VM, you must specify both the VM and disk flavors. The disks parameter
lists a set of disks, separated by commas. Each disk is described by three values:

* name
* flavor
* Either "boot=true" or a size in GB for the disk

Usage: `photon -n vm create --name <VM-NAME> --image <IMAGE-ID> --flavor <VM-FLAVOR> --disk <DISK-DESCRIPTION>`

    % photon -n vm create --name vm-1 --image 8d0b9383-ff64-4112-85db-e8111e2269fc
             --flavor cloud-vm-small --disks "disk-1 cloud-disk boot=true"
